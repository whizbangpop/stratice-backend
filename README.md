# stratice-backend

The backend API server for the Stratice Authentication service.

## What is Stratice?
Stratice is a service designed to allow powerful and dangerous moderation tools to be protected behind a more secure access control than Discord's provided tools, as well as providing in depth audit logging.

# Support
If you have an active Stratice membership, you will have been provided a login for the AviLab Help Desk. Please open a ticket on the help desk, or email support@avilab.zohodesk.eu. We are also working on a new, automated support bot.
